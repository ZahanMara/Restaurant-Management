# Restaurant-Management
Develop an application using the JAVA programming language that will represent a restaurant management system. 
The application can be used by three different types of restaurant employees: administrator, waiter and chef. 
The administrator can add, delete and edit existing products from the menu. Also, the administrator can see the full menu. 
The waiter can create a new order for a table, add elements from the menu, compute the bill for an order and have a look over the entire list of orders that were made in the restaurant. 
The chef is notified each time it must cook food that is ordered through a waiter. Moreover, the chef can see the list with all the orders.
